# MVVM-Kotlin
This application is implemented using MVVM architecture and using data binding where possible. I have used Retrofit2, Picasso and gson for things like networking and rendering images.
I used the https://openweathermap.org/current api to display the current weather for my current location based on my devices GPS. I have also handled cases where no location is found (GPS disabled or off), or the api call fails. I displayed the temperature in Celsius.
